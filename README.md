# bootcamp-projects-portfolio
Hi there, and thanks for viewing my portfolio.

This repository is for all projects that I completed during my bootcamp with The Tech Academy to showcase my proficiencies with various technologies.

I have attempted to organize this portfolio by the coding language used, though I did choose to list the "Live Project" in the main folder of the repository.

Below you will find a quick guide to some of my favorite projects that I would like to share.

It is true that projects in this repository vary in size and scope; some projects are more involved than others.

Nevertheless, I have chosen to include seemingly "minor" assignments alongside the greater ones, as each project or assignment demonstrates my understanding of some programming concept.

Enjoy!
Jesse Sachs

Noteworthy projects:

(1) Twentyone - a game of blackjack that implements basically every C# object oriented programming concept

(2) Calculator - a javascript calculator web application

(3) Photo Upload, Display System (from Live Project) - Effectively created a system that allows users to upload photos to SQL server by implementing .NET MVC and Entity Framework to create CRUD scaffolding.

(4) TicTacToe - a Javascript web application that allows one to play Tic Tac Toe against the computer
